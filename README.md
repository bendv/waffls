waffls is a collection of algorithms for estimating sub-pixel surface water fraction using medium resolution satellite data. Reader classes for Landsat data (Collection-1 and Pre-Collection) as well as Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS) data are included.

## Installation

waffls is built on top of gdal and a number of python libraries. The necessary prerequisite libraries must be installed first, and can be easily accessed through conda. See [here](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/index.html) for instructions on installing conda. 

To install waffls in a separate conda environment, run the following:

```bash
conda create -n waffls -c conda-forge gdal rasterio cython
conda activate waffls
git clone https://github.com/bendv/waffls
cd waffls
python setup.py install
```
